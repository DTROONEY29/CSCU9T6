------ What is a decision support system (DDS) ? -----

A computer based system that COLLECTS, ORGANISES and ANALYSES data to 
facilitate quality business decision making for management, operations 
and planning.

Systems that help people make decsions based on data that is combined 
froma wide variety of sources.

----- What is a Bayesian Network? -----

A Bayesian Network is a way of describing the reltionships between 
CAUSES and EFFECTS, and is made up of nodes and arcs.

NODES: Random variables
ARCS: Äˆasual or influential relationships

For each node - tables give THE CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY of each possible
outcome, given combinations of outcomes from parent nodes (see slides for
diagrams).

----- Applications of Bayesian Networks -----

Main uses : to support decision making and to find strategies to solve 
            tasks under uncertainty.

Nowadays they are used for fault diagnosis, pharma trials, air traffic 
management etc.

----- Uncertainty and Probability -----

The key feature of BNs is that they enable us to MODEL AND REASON about UNCERTAINTY.

We need PROBABILITY to quantify uncertainty

To understand and implement Bayesian networks, we need two mathematical 
tools:

- Probability theory 
- Propositional logic

----- DEFINITIONS -----

UNCERTAINTY : The lack of certainty. A state of having LIMITED KNOWLEDGE 
where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future 
outcome, or more than one possible outcome.

MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAINTY : A set of possible states or outcomes where 
PROBABILITIES are assigned to each possible state or outcome.

RISK: A state of uncertainty where some possible outcomes have an 
UNDESIRED EFFECT or SIGNIFICANT LOSS. 

MEASUREMENT OF RISK : A set of measured uncertanties where some possible outcomes
are losses, and the magnitude of those losses.

----- Dealing with Uncertainty -----

The real world is imperfect and knowledge based systems are expected to
operate in the real-world.

- Missing data
- Ambiguous data 

3 methods of dealing with uncertain reasoning:

- Confidence factors / Certainty factors
- Fuzzy logic
- Bayesian theory

----- Propositional (symbolic) logic -----

LOGIC : the study of the principles of correct reasoning 

PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC: study the ways of joining and/or modifying
entire statements or propositions to form more complex ones.

STATEMENT: a declarative sentance, a complete grammatical sentance that
makes a claim:

- snow is white
- the moon is made of cheese

Statements are considered invisible units. They can be TRUE or FALSE

Letters or simple words (A,B,martin,late) are used to represent statements.
